## Project Structure and Lessons

This project is divided into four main lessons, each building upon the previous one. The key tasks performed in each lesson are outlined below:


- **Description:** This initial lesson serves as an introduction to the project. It covers loading the project data from a JSON file and understanding its structure, which includes user profiles, friend connections, and liked pages.

### 2. Cleaning and Structuring the Data
- **Description:** This phase focuses on data preprocessing. The goal is to prepare the raw, messy data for analysis. This involves creating a structured format that is efficient for querying and manipulation, a crucial step for any data science project.

### 3. Finding "People You May Know"
- **Description:** In this lesson, we implement an algorithm to suggest potential friends to users. The logic typically involves analyzing second-degree connections (friends of friends) to identify people a user might be interested in connecting with.

### 4. Finding "Pages You Might Like"
- **Description:** This finallesson focuses on building a simple recommendation engine. We develop a mechanism to suggest new pages to users based on the pages their friends have liked. This demonstrates a fundamental concept in collaborative filtering.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python:** The core programming language used for all tasks.
- **`json`:** For loading and working with the social network data stored in JSON format.
